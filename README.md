# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

### Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this project is to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program, a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews of their products and determine if there are any biases between Vine members and Non-Vine member's reviews.

Companies that will pay a fee to Amazon and may provide free products to Vine members who are then required to publish a review. In order to determine if there is any bias towards favorable reviews from Vine members vs. non-members, we need to identify the percentage of 5 star ratings to total rating. As part of this exercise, we were asked to choose from 50 datasets to extract, transform and load into a dataframe in order to complete our analysis.

### Results:

Number of Vine reviews:

For our music dataset number of Vine reviews with 5 stars were:

For our music dataset number of non-Vine reviews with 5 stars were:

Hence percentage of Vine reviews that were 5 stars is:

and percentage of non-Vine reviews that were 5 stars is:

## Summary:

From the above analyzed data we concluded that there is no positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. We could perform statistical analysis with this dataset to prove that music reviews are independent of paid vine reviewers. Also. we could analyse other datasets like books, software, etc to confirm our findings.
